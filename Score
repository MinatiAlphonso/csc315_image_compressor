Checkpoint 1:  5%/5%  [git checkout 0e4f399159]

Notes:

   * Magic numbers like these
   
	double mlt = 1.0/765;

    Need explanation for when the person stuck maintaining your code comes
    along and needs to make a change.  A meaningful variable name might also
    be in order.

    Good job so far.

================================================================================
Checkpoint 2:  4%/5%  [git checkout eda2b5bc5f]

*  All points from checkpoint 1 (no regressions)
*  Display original image with vertical lowest energy seam ('v' key)
*  Display original image with horizontal lowest energy seam ('h' key)
*  All team members showing repository activity

-  A small amount of memory leakage probably due to not freeing up the 
event objects after calling doAction on them.

-  Seams are found quickly the vertical seam does not match what most other
   (and mine) implementations show.  How would you check this for accuracy?
   It's not something easily verified visually.
